## Installation

This repository contains a React Native app built with Expo 49 and Expo Router that utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API. To get started, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**

1. Make sure you have Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager), and bun (unix system only) installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and [bun website](bun.sh/docs/cli/bunx).

2. You should also have Expo CLI installed globally. If not, you can install it using:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

**Clone the Repository:**

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```

4. Change the directory to the cloned project:

   ```
